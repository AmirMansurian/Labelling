# Labelling
#### We have an Image "Cells.tif" we want to count number of cells in Image and label them to calculate Area and average light level for each cell.
#### Here I have used Average kernel filter and otsu treshholding to segment Image and use Stack to Label cells.at last save Area and Average pixel value for each cell in an excel sheet.
